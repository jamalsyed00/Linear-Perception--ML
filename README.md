# Linear-Perception--ML
Machine Learning Assignment-1 

The model we have implemented is the one detailed in Bishop’s “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning”. The dataset is given a 70:30 split, and achieved a testing and
training accuracy of 100, the algorithm clearly converged on an exact solution.
